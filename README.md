# cli-diction

### This app takes a user's text input and retrieves information about each word using the Rubymuse wrapper by Alex Gontar to retrieve API data from Datamuse. Functions include retrieving definitions, synonyms, spellchecking individual words and text from sentences, and providing suggested spellings. Results and accuracy are not guaranteed and are completely dependent on Datamuse's database.
